            <h1 style="line-height: 40px;">The Origins and Natural Habitat of the Tikiw Plant</h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The Tikiw plant is a large, erect aquatic or marshy herb natively grown in the Philippines, flourishing in freshwater swamps, marshlands, and low-altitude rice fields. Found in huge quantities in Central Luzon and Mindanao, tikiw has been along with Filipino craftsmanship. Historical records point to as early as the 1700s, in the Spanish colonial period, where Filipino communities in the countryside and coastal areas started using tikiw for everyday utensils. Its fibers are strong and flexible, with which baskets, mats, rugs, and ropes can be woven.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">Tikiw is harvested during dry seasons when marshy lands become accessible. Artisans cut tall stalks of marshland, dry them out under the sun, and prepare the fibers for weaving—both a skill and patience endeavor. These fibers are changed into products ranging from very practical things like storage baskets to shopping bags and intricate works of beauty. This sustainable art form formed a part of the countryside economy, as in parts of Central Luzon, there was an overabundance of tikiw inside rice paddies and other wetlands areas.

                    Tikiw Weaving: A Legacy of Livelihood and Culture
                    - By the 1800s, tikiw weaving had become an essential source of livelihood for most Filipino families, especially in Central Luzon, where farming and handcrafting became intertwined. Coastal communities sharpen their weaving skills and share the traditional methods passed from generation to generation. This art of tikiw weaving also became a statement of Filipino resilience and ingenuity, especially during scarcity situations when natural resources were stretched to the limit for economic and practical purposes.</p>
